Notes on data science, machine learning, artificial intelligence, history, and social science.

## Procedures

- Don't combine static images and images generated from a notebook in a notebook. Currently the deployment process regenerates (and writes over) all image folders. Instead, put the static files in the static/images folder and link them from there. This procedure does not apply to markdown posts.
